# 3. FEATURES 

## INDEX PAGE
## Random name listing
The website has the ability to create dynamic names of dog for both sexes,  the functionality enables the 
user to select a new name if they do not accept the name they are given, as many times as the names are random
from the male and female array.

## Images of correct sex of dog shown on the webpage after selection
The javascript code has DOM (Document Object Model) to manipulate the webpage to produce male or female images
of puppies when selecting from radio buttons.  The images are responsive and set at the correct sizes in WebP 
format.

## Responsive Design
Mobile first design concept was used throught this project,  at the UX/UI stage of design wire frame design 
documents where used to get a clear concise page that meets the objective, This project only requires one page
as a future, and it is possible that this script will be used in a further project.

# Design choice

## Colour Scheme
- I opted for a simplistic colour scheme of Grey/Green #373E3D White #FFFFFF Green RGB(0,128, 0) 
and Blue RGB(0,255,0) for social media font awesome icons.  White for text against Grey/Green 
background DIVS and black text against white background.   The Button that we have used is a 
success button on bootstrap 4.6.2.

## Fonts 
- Due to the objective being to create a website page with javascript manipulating the DOM we
have decided to use default fonts.  The typeface is clear and well defined for the purpose of 
this task.

## Banner
- Due to the objective of this task no banner is used for this web page, as the objective is 
to highlight my ability to manipulate the DOM.

# 5. WIREFRAMES

The diagrams below show the wireframe layout in Web and Mobile formats,  these wireframe diagrams 
show the website upon loading the page,  if this view is required after using the Dog NAme chooser 
either refresh the page or reload the website. The design will stay close to these images produced 
however there might be some modifications from the original wireframe design.
